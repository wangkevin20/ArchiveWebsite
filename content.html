        <p>Originally, I had more ideas to include in this website but as I talked about in the About page, It was too wide spread and there's not really a connection between them all.</p>

        <p>Some of these ideas beside ones based on wars were history, biology, some science stuff, Etc, Etc. My initial idea was to talk about government approved hijinks, but as stated before, it gets confusing after the first while.</p>
        
        <p>In all honesty, most of these ideas came from youtube channels that I like to put in the background and the videos they made. These were the creators are what inspired the contents in this website and if you want, you can check their channels bellow</p>
