            The War of the Bucket or War of the Oaken Bucket, was a long 300 long battle between the pope and Holy Roman Empire.

            The war of the bucket was one of many battles that happened during that time frame but itâ€™s notorious for the idea that a battle happened when a bucket got stolen. In reality, said bucket was never stolen but rather won after the battle as like a war trophy.

          <p id="typewriter-text2" style="display: none;">
            As for why the battle occurred, It probably just because they both were just on opposing forces so a battle would eventually happen.
