<p>This whole archive is dedicated to many unusual or funny reasons why we went to war</p>
<p>Most, if not all of these contents are inspired by certain videos that I watch in the background</p>
<p>Origionally, I've planned to incorporate alot more different content but it made the whole website a bit</p> 
<p>too crowed and confusing. So instead I toned down the topics to just wars and nothing else.</p>
