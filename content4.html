            The Emu wars was a series of short battles between Australians and emus during 1932.
          </p>
          <p id="typewriter-text2" style="display: none;">
            This battle occurred after the economic downturn of the Great Depression where Australia, who heavily relied on its export industries as such no other nation would be buying .
          </p>
          <p id="typewriter-text2" style="display: none;">
            This resulted in more farmers but due to how many were not able to make money, most left for city work and for those who stayed, an Emu problem arose.
          </p>
          <p id="typewriter-text2" style="display: none;">
            Emus are large tacky birds that were able to destroy fences and consume the little wheat farmers were able to grow in Australian soil.
          </p>
          <p id="typewriter-text2" style="display: none;">
            Around 20 thousand emus cost struggling farmers millions in terms of lost profits, so much so they manage to convince their government to eradicate these pests with military grade weapons.
          </p>
          <p id="typewriter-text2" style="display: none;">
            The initial battle was said to be a success but the statistic showed that between the 20,000 emus only 1000 were killed whilst using up 10,000 rounds of ammunition.
