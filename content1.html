        <p id="typewriter-text1">During the Oregon Treaty of June 15 1846, due confusion between the border declaration of the United States and the British, an argument arose between who gets to keep which portions of the San Juan Islands.</p>
        <p id="typewriter-text2" style="display: none;">Because of this ambiguity, both the United States and Britain claimed sovereignty over the San Juan Islands. During this period of disputed sovereignty, Britain's Hudson's Bay Company established operations on San Juan and turned the island into a sheep ranch.</p>
        <p id="typewriter-text3" style="display: none;">The Americans Seeing this, retaliated and began the back and forth between the two nations which only escalated the situation even more, so much so that an American general, William S. Harney eventually did the unthinkable action of landing American troops in disputed territory.</p>
        <p id="typewriter-text4" style="display: none;">The escalation of the situation only started On June 15, 1859, Lyman Cutlar, an American farmer who had moved onto San Juan Island claiming rights to live there under the Donation Land Claim Act, found a pig rooting in his garden and eating his potatoes. This was not the first occurrence and as a result Cutler shot the pig, killing it. It turned out that the pig was owned by an Irishman, Charles Griffin, who was employed by the Hudson's Bay Company to run the sheep ranch on the island.] He also owned several pigs that he allowed to roam freely. The two had lived in peace until this incident. Cutlar offered $10 (equivalent to $330 in 2022) to Griffin to compensate for the pig, but Griffin was unsatisfied with this offer and demanded $100 (equivalent to $3,300 in 2022). Following this reply, Cutler believed he should not have to pay for the pig because the pig had been trespassing on his land. One likely apocryphal account has Cutlar saying to Griffin, "It was eating my potatoes''; and Griffin replying, "It is up to you to keep your potatoes out of my pig." When British authorities threatened to arrest Cutlar, American settlers called for military protection Which led to Harney landing American troops.</p>
        <p id="typewriter-text5" style="display: none;">When news about the crisis reached London and Washington, D.C., officials from both nations were shocked and took action to calm the potentially explosive international incident.</p>
        <p id="typewriter-text6" style="display: none;">In September, U.S. President James Buchanan sent General Winfield Scott to negotiate with Governor Douglas and resolve the growing crisis. This was in the best interest of the United States, as sectionalist tensions within the country were increasing, soon to culminate in the Civil War. Scott had calmed two other border crises between the two nations in the late 1830s. He arrived in the San Juans in October and began negotiations with Douglas. As a result of the negotiations, both sides agreed to retain joint military occupation of the island until a final settlement could be reached, reducing their presence to a token force of no more than 100 men.</p>
        <p id="typewriter-text7" style="display: none;">During the years of joint military occupation, the small British and American units on San Juan Island had an amicable mutual social life, visiting one another's camps to celebrate their respective national holidays and holding various athletic competitions. Park rangers tell visitors the biggest threat to peace on the island during these years was "the large amounts of alcohol available".</p>
        <p id="typewriter-text8" style="display: none;">On October 21, 1872, the commission decided in favor of the United States' offer. The arbitrators chose the American-preferred marine boundary via Haro Strait, to the west of the islands, over the British preference for Rosario Strait which lay to their east. On November 25, 1872, the British withdrew their Royal Marines from the British camp. The Americans followed by July 1874. The Pig War is commemorated in San Juan Island National Historical Park.</p>
